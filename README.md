I really love the idea of Advent of Code, so here goes! All solutions that I build for the challenges will be kept here.
I will also try and use this as a way to get to know different languages.

## Project Structure
Yearly folders are organized as such:
```
+-- Y0000
    +-- D00
    |    +--- go.mod
    |    +--- input.txt
    |    +--- main.go
    |    +--- main_test.go
```
