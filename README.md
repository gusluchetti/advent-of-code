I really love the idea of Advent of Code, so here goes! All solutions that I build for the challenges will be kept here.
I will also try and use this as a way to get to know different languages.

This is all heavily inspired by https://github.com/LLBlumire/advent-of-code, I'm trying to replicate his setup of easily running any solutions and/or generating a code framework for new puzzles.

## Project Structure
Yearly folders are organized as such:
```
+-- src    
|    +-- Y2020
|    |    +-- D01
|    |    |    +--- go.mod
|    |    |    +--- input.txt
|    |    |    +--- main.go
|    |    |    +--- main_test.go
|    |    +-- (...)
|    +-- Y2021
.    .
.    .
.    .
```
