I really love the idea of Advent of Code, so here goes! All solutions that I build for the challenges will be kept here.
I will also try and use this as a way to get to know different languages.

This structure is inspired by [LBlumire's AoC repo](https://github.com/LLBlumire/advent-of-code) and [echojs's AoC gists](https://gist.github.com/echojc), I like the idea of automatically parsing inputs depending on the puzzle's need (ints, strings), and having a template that is ready for use when attempting new solutions. I'd love to be able to use multiple languages in this repo, but I haven't figured that out (yet).

## Project Structure
Yearly folders are organized as such:
```
+-- src    
|    +-- Y2020
|    |    +-- D01
|    |    |    +--- go.mod
|    |    |    +--- input.txt
|    |    |    +--- main.go
|    |    |    +--- main_test.go
|    |    +-- (...)
|    +-- Y2021
.    .
.    .
.    .
```
